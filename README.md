No build required. Open index.html

Framework used: ReactJS

I did not use Create React App. This is because this is a very small scale project. Create React App contains a lot of others things that is not needed in this project and also requires to be build. So I want to make it more convenient to see my work and save time from building the project.
So I followed https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html to add React to my simple webpage. And used JSX Preprocessor to convert JSX into normal javascript.
"src/menuItems.js" is the actual code I wrote, "./menuItems.js" is code generated by Babel.

Reason to use:

1. Reusable Components:
   For menu items, the same style is used for each of the menu items. ReactJS allows me to able to reuse the same component to create all the menu items. By extracting components, it also makes the code more readable.

2. JSX:
   With JSX, html tags can be used within javascript file. It allows logics to be added within components, making it easier to write logics that manipulates the DOM.

3. React State Management:
   In this project, many DOM needs to be changed based on some states, e.g. the total price in basket. With React State I am able to just change the state, and it will automatically rerender the DOM. There is no extra codes need to be written to changes the content of the DOM when state changes.

To see the webpage in action, you just have to open index.html :)
